    <content>Such a simple concept that so many grasp, and others don't. I struggle with feeding myself every single day, and doing the things I need to do such as cleaning the house or planning doctors visits. If you take care of plants, try taking care of yourself while you're doing the same for them. Got a dog? Prepare both of your meals at the same time. We deserve to be cared for by ourselves. You're worth that, I promise. #fyp #mentalhealth #trans </content>

But, it's getting better. The main focus is today, and that's all we can do. Love yourself in the making. And don't forget to be human.  #fyp #trans </content>

    <title>They're fucking amazing.  I had to wear this brace for 3 months after my MCL replacement. It's making me feel a certain way wearing it again on the opposite, but my partner is helping me so much. Haha. Just a reminder to change my perspective. ‚ò∫Ô∏è #fyp </title>
