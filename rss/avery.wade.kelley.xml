    <content>3 Years Sober from Alcohol. It was hard. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. It was so hard in the beginning, and then it wasn't. Something switched in me in my first year of sobriety, and it told me that I can never drink alcohol again. And I'm proud of that voice. It has saved my life. It has saved my relationships, my body, and my mind.  I can remember what I do every day. I can control my emotions (somewhat), and I can take a look at myself and know that I am no longer drowning in a bottle. I can now look deeper within.  If you're struggling with the drink, take a second to ask yourself why you're doing it. Why it is so important to escape. And NEVER be afraid to reach out for help. There are Sober people EVERYWHERE, and we all know the struggle. We all know what it's like to feel alone and hopeless. You are NOT alone. I promise. #fyp #trans </content>

    <title>My sister sent me this song, I had forgotten about it, fell in love with it again, and learned it in 30 minutes. Toy Story is a strange thing for me, since my father sang the Spanish dub of it. But... Maybe this is what healing looks like... #fyp </title>
