    <content>World Athletics' ban is transphobia, misogynistic, racist, discriminatory, and harmful. President Sebastian Coe claims that this is in effort to protect women and women's category, but excluding trans women threatens all women in the entire women's category through the policing of women's bodies and womanhood. This ruling is devastating, and deeply upsetting, especially when taken with the hundreds of anti-trans legislation, precenting children from playing sports with their friends. #Tr#TransAthleter#Transgenderi#LiaThomasr#TransManr#TransWomeno#WomensSportso#WorldAthleticsi#Finao#WorldAquaticsA#IAAFra#TransRights</content>

You're being played by the system that wants to distract you deom the real problem - which is NOT trans people or transness.
