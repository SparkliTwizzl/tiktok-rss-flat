    <title>#AdCouncilPartner | Love is an action, not just a feeling. I spent a lot of my childhood being bullied, being othered, and being told I wasn’t enough. Still, I was incredibly lucky to find adults around me who showed me love. Who saved my life by doing so</title>

    <content>Part 7 @Schuyler Bailar  | The last of this series about my conversation with a pastor about gender! Overall my interaction with him was good; we do not agree on everything but I deeply appreciated how we could have a calm conversation and that he was open to learning.
