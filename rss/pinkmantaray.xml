    <title>NYC book talk at @Greenlight Bookstore was packed with barely even any standing room... I stood up to speak nearly crying. This work is so difficult and joyful, so grief-stricken and hope-filled, and I am so grateful to be able to do it. Join in the fight</title>

    <content>Educating and sharing about trans identity is not grooming and is not problematic. In fact, we have a responsibility as a society to educate youth on the full diversity of identity, instead of forcing them into a box. Affirming a child's declaration of identity, no matter what kind, can be lifesaving. Denying them their right to understanding their own selves is cruel. More on de-transition tomorrow. Learn much more through my book, HSTBook.com/buy. Signed copies are selling out so go grab one now!  St. Louis, I'll see you in a few hours!! RSVP for tonight or another tour stop here: HSTBook.com/tour 💕 #transgender #transition #transkids #genderaffirmingcare </content>

    <content>Mythbusting detransition rhetoric! For citations, visit pinkmantaray.com/facts and for a full breakdown of this topic, read my book: HSTBook.com! FACTS: ▪️Detransition is significantly uncommon. ▪️Most people detransition because of transphobia, not because they are not actually trans. ▪️Detransition is not usually experienced as harmful when parents and society are supportive of exploration. ▪️When medical mistakes happen, we should not ban medical care, we should work to improve it. ▪️Gender-affirming care has been approved by every major medical association as appropriate and even often lifesaving. Don't let anti-trans rhetoric trick you! #transgender #trans #heshethey #genderaffirmingcare #transkids</content>
