    <content>What better way to ring in #TransAwarenessWeek than grabbing a copy of @raquel willis book that launched today?! In this episode of Dear Schuyler, Raquel and I discuss her memoir, The Risk It Takes To Bloom - and especially her relationship with her parents. Throughout the episode and in her book, Raquel invites us into so much of her life and offers endless wisdom throughout. Don't miss this episode or her book! On a personal note, I'm so thankful for Raquel's work and example. She is the definition of poise and empowerment and I learn something from her every time I'm lucky to share space. Congratulations on your book launch, Raquel. May everyone read it 🙏🏼📘💕🏳️‍⚧️ #transgender #theriskittakestobloom #raquelwillis #dearschuyler</content>

    <content>Tune in for a critical episode of #DearSchuyler with attorney @ChaseStrangio. Chase has been a longtime comrade of mine - his work is saving lives, fighting the anti-trans legislation that has plagued our country. Take a listen to learn more about why there are so many anti-trans bills. Why so many? Why now?? Chase, thank you so much for what you do. We are all indebted to you 💕🏳️‍⚧️ #transgender #podcast #antitranslegislation </content>

    <content>On my run this morning I found myself thinking about all the ridiculous comments people make about "trans woman domination" with regards to sports - so I thought I'd share some numbers that might be helpful. Consider the following: ▪️Trans athletes have been permitted to compete in the category aligned with their gender identity since 2003. ▪️Only one trans woman has ever competed in the women's Olympic category. ▪️5,000 women compete in the Olympics each Olympic cycle. Trans people make up 1% of the population; we should have 50 trans women competing each Olympics. ▪️480,000 athletes compete in the NCAA yearly. ▪️2 trans women have women national championships in the NCAA, ever. Trans athletes and trans women in particular do NOT threaten sport. Transphobia does. For a full breakdown, and a special interview with Lia Thomas (one of the aforementioned two trans women who've won an NCAA title), check out my book, He/She/They: How We Talk About Gender and Why It Matters. #transgender #transathlete #trans </content>
