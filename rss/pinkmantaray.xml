    <content>HELP ME CALL DAX IN. A recent episode of the Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard and @JVN features Dax pushing JVN about trans athletes, claiming to be an ally but also leaning into some dangerous territory. I respect Dax and his work - I have enjoyed his podcast - and I believe he wants to be an ally. And because of this, I am certain that he can be more intentional about how he has this conversation. In fact, it is his responsibility as someone with a platform and power to be intentional and careful, especially if he wants his actions to align with his statements of allyship. Dax, if you want to discuss trans athletes and trans people in sports from a place of respect, allyship, and compassion, do so when everyone is prepared to have that conversation. Please send this to Dax on IG to call him in. The conversation about trans athletes too frequently is done without care or compassion. If you want to talk about us, talk WITH us. #transgender #transathlete #trans #armchairexpertpodcast</content>

My upcoming book, He/She/They: How We Talk About Gender and Why It Matters, can help you get a head start!

    <content>NYC book talk at @Greenlight Bookstore was packed with barely even any standing room... I stood up to speak nearly crying. This work is so difficult and joyful, so grief-stricken and hope-filled, and I am so grateful to be able to do it. Join in the fight by grabbing a copy at HSTBook.com. There will be signed copies all over NYC by the end of the day tomorrow. #transgender #heshethey #transauthor </content>
