    <content>Tune in for this weeks episode of #DearSchuyler, with the lovely @Elle DeranðŸ’•. Elle joined me for a conversation about how we learn to feel the most like ourselves, regardless of whether or not we are transgender. Our journeys as trans people can be a beautiful invitation to dive deeper into ourselves, and perhaps inspire others to do the same.  Sometimes those who dislike us the most are actually experiencing us as reflections of something they're not yet ready to confront in themselves.  Take a listen wherever you get your podcasts! #transgender #podcast </content>

    <content>Join me in talking with trans athlete and amazing human, @Angel Flores on this week's episode of #DearSchuyler. Angel's story was spotlit in Queer Eye a few years ago and since has used her platform to talk about her experience as an athlete and trans person. She is funny, smart, powerful and empowered. I was inspired by her outlook on her life, particularly when talking about sports as a trans person. Anyone can - and should - learn from her. Take a listen to our conversation anywhere you get your podcasts! #transgender #transathlete #podcast </content>
