    <content>This week's #DearSchuyler brings you a vulnerable, striking, and deeply compassionate conversation with consultant and educator, @Addison Rose Vincent 🙏🏼 I've listened to this episode a few times now and every time I do, I learn something new from Addison. I reflect a little deeper. I challenge my own internalized transphobia. I'm so grateful for all Addison has offered us. Take a listen wherever you get your podcasts 💕 #transgender #trans #podcast</content>

    <content>HELP ME CALL DAX IN. A recent episode of the Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard and @JVN features Dax pushing JVN about trans athletes, claiming to be an ally but also leaning into some dangerous territory. I respect Dax and his work - I have enjoyed his podcast - and I believe he wants to be an ally. And because of this, I am certain that he can be more intentional about how he has this conversation. In fact, it is his responsibility as someone with a platform and power to be intentional and careful, especially if he wants his actions to align with his statements of allyship. Dax, if you want to discuss trans athletes and trans people in sports from a place of respect, allyship, and compassion, do so when everyone is prepared to have that conversation. Please send this to Dax on IG to call him in. The conversation about trans athletes too frequently is done without care or compassion. If you want to talk about us, talk WITH us. #transgender #transathlete #trans #armchairexpertpodcast</content>

    <content>#NationalComingOutDay is always a moment for me to reflect.
