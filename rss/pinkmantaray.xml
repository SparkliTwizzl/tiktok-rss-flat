    <content>CW: Discussion of suicide.
 
 Nearly a decade ago, I found myself deeply alone in my own dark thoughts. I was miserable and had stopped seeing myself in the future. In that moment, reaching out for help saved my life. Talking about suicide can be difficult and painful – and society often adds another layer of shame and judgment that only worsens the experience. Talking about suicide and what leads a person to ending their own life can help prevent it. This is why I'm partnering with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention @afspnational. Research, support, and humanity are at the core of this fight. Get involved at the link in my bio!
