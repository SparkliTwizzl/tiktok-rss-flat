    <content>So-called "Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminism" or "TERF" ideology is most certainly exclusion - and absolutely NOT feminism. On my podcast this week, I answered several listener questions like this one. I really enjoyed making this episode because I got to address many of the things that I know drum up quite a bit of controversy and tension. I hope you find it useful - take a listen to DEAR SCHUYLER anywhere you get your podcasts! #dearschuyler #transgender #transpodcast #podcast </content>
