    <content>What better way to ring in #TransAwarenessWeek than grabbing a copy of @raquel willis book that launched today?! In this episode of Dear Schuyler, Raquel and I discuss her memoir, The Risk It Takes To Bloom - and especially her relationship with her parents. Throughout the episode and in her book, Raquel invites us into so much of her life and offers endless wisdom throughout. Don't miss this episode or her book! On a personal note, I'm so thankful for Raquel's work and example. She is the definition of poise and empowerment and I learn something from her every time I'm lucky to share space. Congratulations on your book launch, Raquel. May everyone read it 🙏🏼📘💕🏳️‍⚧️ #transgender #theriskittakestobloom #raquelwillis #dearschuyler</content>

Chase has been a longtime comrade of mine - his work is saving lives, fighting the anti-trans legislation that has plagued our country. Take a listen to learn more about why there are so many anti-trans bills. Why so many? Why now?? Chase, thank you so much for what you do. We are all indebted to you 💕🏳️‍⚧️ #transgender #podcast #antitranslegislation </content>
