    <content>#AdCouncilPartner | Love is an action, not just a feeling. I spent a lot of my childhood being bullied, being othered, and being told I wasn‚Äôt enough. Still, I was incredibly lucky to find adults around me who showed me love. Who saved my life by doing so. We all deserve access to this. Trans children are less likely to be suicidal if they have at least one supportive adult in their lives. Be that person. @Ad Council #PSA #lovehasnolabels #transgender #allyship</content>
