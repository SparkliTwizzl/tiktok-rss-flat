    <content>Educating and sharing about trans identity is not grooming and is not problematic. In fact, we have a responsibility as a society to educate youth on the full diversity of identity, instead of forcing them into a box. Affirming a child's declaration of identity, no matter what kind, can be lifesaving. Denying them their right to understanding their own selves is cruel. More on de-transition tomorrow. Learn much more through my book, HSTBook.com/buy. Signed copies are selling out so go grab one now!  St. Louis, I'll see you in a few hours!!

    <content>Mythbusting detransition rhetoric! For citations, visit pinkmantaray.com/facts and for a full breakdown of this topic, read my book: HSTBook.com! FACTS: ▪️Detransition is significantly uncommon. ▪️Most people detransition because of transphobia, not because they are not actually trans. ▪️Detransition is not usually experienced as harmful when parents and society are supportive of exploration. ▪️When medical mistakes happen, we should not ban medical care, we should work to improve it. ▪️Gender-affirming care has been approved by every major medical association as appropriate and even often lifesaving. Don't let anti-trans rhetoric trick you! #transgender #trans #heshethey #genderaffirmingcare #transkids</content>

    <content>What better way to ring in #TransAwarenessWeek than grabbing a copy of @raquel willis book that launched today?! In this episode of Dear Schuyler, Raquel and I discuss her memoir, The Risk It Takes To Bloom - and especially her relationship with her parents. Throughout the episode and in her book, Raquel invites us into so much of her life and offers endless wisdom throughout. Don't miss this episode or her book! On a personal note, I'm so thankful for Raquel's work and example. She is the definition of poise and empowerment and I learn something from her every time I'm lucky to share space. Congratulations on your book launch, Raquel. May everyone read it 🙏🏼📘💕🏳️‍⚧️ #transgender #theriskittakestobloom #raquelwillis #dearschuyler</content>
