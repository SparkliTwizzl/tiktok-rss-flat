Still, I was incredibly lucky to find adults around me who showed me love. Who saved my life by doing so. We all deserve access to this. Trans children are less likely to be suicidal if they have at least one supportive adult in their lives. Be that person. @Ad Council #PSA #lovehasnolabels #transgender #allyship</content>

    <content>Part 7 @Schuyler Bailar  | The last of this series about my conversation with a pastor about gender! Overall my interaction with him was good; we do not agree on everything but I deeply appreciated how we could have a calm conversation and that he was open to learning. Grateful for @August bringing me along to be in moments like this! #florida #hb1069 #transgender #learning #gender #conversation </content>
