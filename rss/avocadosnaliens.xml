    <content>#greenscreen when i was in my last relationship, my ex took this photo of me at a fancy restaurant in malibu. I was drunk almost everyday. My face was inflamed, i was 30 lbs heavier, i had so much brain fog, constantly anxious. I had myself convinced that a relationship would fix all of my problems. I cut myself off from everything when i broke things off with him. I stopped drinking. I hid myself in my apartment. Worked on my business. Worked on being a better mother. I was lonely. The loneliest i had ever been. But it took a long time to realize that lonliness does not equate unhappiness. I got used to being by myself. And it forced me to find happiness in myself. Dude-not every day is perfect. But i have found that my comfort comes from within me and me only. And i hope this sparks some inspiration in others who feel like they have to seek that feeling in other placesü´∂</content>
