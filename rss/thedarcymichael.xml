    <content>I like to share this story every national coming out day not to celebrate me coming out but to remind parents its their job to love their kids unconditionally. The greatest gift my parents ever gave me was that of freedom to be myself. I found a partner I love, we raised a daughter, we made a good life for ourselves and their choices that day helped lay the groundwork. Parents, be the hope your child needs #standup #comingout #storytime #comedy #parenting </content>

    <content>We never want to let anyone down but we have to this time unfortunately.  Full statement:  Hi creeps,Â  It is with the heaviest heart that we have to postpone the remainder of this weeks shows.Â  On last nights show, I tore my meniscus in my knee doing one too many bum drops - as one does for the people! Iâ€™ve been ordered to rest (aka ADHD torture) and not perform for the next few weeks while we wait to hear it if I need surgery.Â  We will announce the new make up dates as soon as possible.  Iâ€™m so so sorry, please send Jer all your condolences while he has to deal with me.Â  Tolerate you all ! Darcy and JerÂ  We will be back new york, washington, philly, albany, I promise.
