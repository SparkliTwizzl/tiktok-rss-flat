    <content>since today is Mental Health Awareness day and also ADHD awareness month, I wanted to to take a second to acknowledge how incredible it has been performing on this tour in theatres full of other neurodivergent friends.  I dont remember ever being in a room that has felt more safe, or loving, as we have on this silly little comedy tour.  Whether people are coming with their friends or family or coming on their own, our hope is that whoever is in the audience leaves feeling happy and secure in themselves.  Thank you for giving us a platform to spread some comedy and joy around some topics that might not get enough light some days.  Be kind to yourself and go take your meds. #mentalhealthawareness #adhd #adhdawarenessmonth #comedy #standup #busydonkey #neurodivergent</content>

    <content>this was an emotional roller coaster!  #standupcomedy #adhd #busydonkey #couplecomedy #popquiz #overheard #justforlaughs  I dont know if its lame to talk about the stress of touring or performing cuz I also understand that what we do is very silly. However before tiktok, the most I think I ever sold to a show was maybe 300 and here we are a few years later embarking on this wild adventure with you all.  Weâ€™re both always so touched when people even want to watch our silly videos let alone leave their house to come see us live. So a genuine thank you to everyone that has made plans to see us. But also just as much thanks to everyone here on tiktok that watches our content online, yall have changed our lives.  We cant wait to disappoint you ðŸ¤“</content>
