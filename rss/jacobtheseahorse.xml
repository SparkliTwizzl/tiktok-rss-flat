    <content>Replying to @ms_nightstar this was a difficult video to record and I imagine it might be a difficult video to watch. please be careful with yourself while watching. being targeted during my pregnancy was an event that triggered a deeply powerful shift in my mental health that left me very unwell for 2 years and hugely affected my relationship with my baby (and everyone else). I was also let down by mental health services despite reaching out for help, but that's another story  #trans #mentalhealth #SA #survivor #storytime #transgender #pregnancy #tw </content>

    <content>#duet with @THOSE GUYS #Duet  starting my medical transition 13 years ago there were so many unknowns and I was terrified that I would lose my ability to sing. it took me a long time to work out how to sing with this new voice and for a long time I was scared to sing because I couldn't pitch properly. it brings me such joy to see all the voice coaches and things that are available now, it would have made such a difference to me to have access to that! #voice #song #testosteronevoiceupdate #testosterone #transition #adele #lgbt #trans #singing #music #tvoice </content>

I took testosterone thinking it would make me infertile and I deeply grieved the loss of my fertility. but I got hope when I saw other trans guys getting pregnant and I took the leap to pause testosterone and try.  and now I'm a Papa to two littles that I grew in my body. #transpregnancy #trans #transgender #lgbt #babies #testosterone #hormones #fertility #pregnancy #parents </content>
