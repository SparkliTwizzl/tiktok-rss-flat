    <content>#duet with @THOSE GUYS #Duet  starting my medical transition 13 years ago there were so many unknowns and I was terrified that I would lose my ability to sing. it took me a long time to work out how to sing with this new voice and for a long time I was scared to sing because I couldn't pitch properly. it brings me such joy to see all the voice coaches and things that are available now, it would have made such a difference to me to have access to that! #voice #song #testosteronevoiceupdate #testosterone #transition #adele #lgbt #trans #singing #music #tvoice </content>

    <content>Replying to @fxshboness I wish I had solid data to give you but it doesn't exist yet.  I took testosterone thinking it would make me infertile and I deeply grieved the loss of my fertility. but I got hope when I saw other trans guys getting pregnant and I took the leap to pause testosterone and try.  and now I'm a Papa to two littles that I grew in my body. #transpregnancy #trans #transgender #lgbt #babies #testosterone #hormones #fertility #pregnancy #parents </content>

    <content>#duet with @cammi mcdermott üåà #nonbinary I'm supposed to be asleep but I had to sing with this because it spoke to me in such a deep way.  (I'm singing quietly so I don't wake my kids!) my transness is so important to me and for me that involves loving and cherishing the part of me that moved through the world as a girl.  I was trans, even back then, but we didn't have the language for that and so I experienced girlhood in a trans way. rolled up sleeves and all. #trans #eras #change #selfcare </content>
