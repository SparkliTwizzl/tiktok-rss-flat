    <content>Replying to @pickingpoppies68 it's hard because our neurodivergency is a core part of who we are and how we process. For me, I still feel like I have ADHD when I'm on the meds, but I also feel so much clearer and able to access more of my mind.  I hope this analogy helps, it's the image I get whenever I try and think about what it feels like.  #adhd #adhdmeds #nd #audhd #neurodiverse #adhdtiktok </content>

    <content>#stitch with @Arctic Harmacist  let's keep these conversations going and flip the narrative so Autism and ADHD are understood from within and not without. my understanding of what it means to be neurodivergent has completely changed thanks to community and social media.  I am working in my internalised ableism which makes me want to mask at my own expense and allowing myself to be inconvenient.  #actuallyautistic #audhd #adhd #neurospicy #neurospicycrew #queer #lgbt #trans #inconvenient </content>
