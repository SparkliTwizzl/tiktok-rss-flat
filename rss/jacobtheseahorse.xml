    <content>#stitch with @Arctic Harmacist  let's keep these conversations going and flip the narrative so Autism and ADHD are understood from within and not without. my understanding of what it means to be neurodivergent has completely changed thanks to community and social media.  I am working in my internalised ableism which makes me want to mask at my own expense and allowing myself to be inconvenient.  #actuallyautistic #audhd #adhd #neurospicy #neurospicycrew #queer #lgbt #trans #inconvenient </content>

    <title>Replying to @kismetkat22 thanks for the question, I think some people want to cause dissent and so are giving the impression that trans people are forcing things on women, when that's the last thing we want! we are allies in the fight against patriarchy. </title>

    <content>Replying to @kismetkat22 thanks for the question, I think some people want to cause dissent and so are giving the impression that trans people are forcing things on women, when that's the last thing we want! we are allies in the fight against patriarchy. we are just asking to be included, especially in perinatal spaces where we (and our babies) are more at risk of exclusion.  #trans #ally #chestfeeding #breastfeeding #humanmilk #chestsurgery #infantfeeding #women #midwives #healthvisitors #feminism #intersectionalfeminism </content>
