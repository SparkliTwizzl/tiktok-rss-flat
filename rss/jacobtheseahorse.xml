    <title>pregnancy isn't inherently gendered or inherently womanly. it is a deeply human experience.  a woman's femininity isn't impacted by not experiencing pregnancy and it didn't make me any less masculine that I did. #bestpart #trans #transpregnancy #dad #cis </title>

    <content>#duet with @cammi mcdermott ðŸŒˆ #nonbinary I'm supposed to be asleep but I had to sing with this because it spoke to me in such a deep way.  (I'm singing quietly so I don't wake my kids!) my transness is so important to me and for me that involves loving and cherishing the part of me that moved through the world as a girl.  I was trans, even back then, but we didn't have the language for that and so I experienced girlhood in a trans way. rolled up sleeves and all. #trans #eras #change #selfcare </content>
