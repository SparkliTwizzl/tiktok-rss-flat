    <title>Replying to @sunrise_sam ah there it is. it doesn't usually take long for the true colours to show. cis is not a harmful term, it just means "not-trans", the pushback against it is entirely driven by transphobia #cis #trans #honesty #queer #lgbt #queertok</title>

    <title>Replying to @akj7368 I hope this clarifies things both trans and cis people have genders, the only difference is that our genders don'tv align with our sex at birth (and the gender assumptions that come along with that) #trans #cis #gender #transgender #q</title>
