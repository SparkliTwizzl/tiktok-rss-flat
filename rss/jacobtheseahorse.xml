    <content>Replying to @emrhibee if someone falls pregnant and wants to continue a pregnancy then they must stop taking it immediately. this is no different than if someone is on any meds that can impact a pregnancy.  I train midwives to refer to obstetrician care if there's an overlap of testosterone with pregnancy and this is just another reason why training is so important. #trans #testosterone #hormones #pregnancy #obstetrics #midwifery </content>

    <content>Replying to @ms_nightstar this was a difficult video to record and I imagine it might be a difficult video to watch. please be careful with yourself while watching. being targeted during my pregnancy was an event that triggered a deeply powerful shift in my mental health that left me very unwell for 2 years and hugely affected my relationship with my baby (and everyone else). I was also let down by mental health services despite reaching out for help, but that's another story  #trans #mentalhealth #SA #survivor #storytime #transgender #pregnancy #tw </content>
