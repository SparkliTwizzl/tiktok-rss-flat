    <content>Replying to @account57959  all figures in this came from chatGPT which may have pulled these figures out of its proverbial. but the point still stands, we often make accomodations for the 1%, often with unexpected benefits for others too. a trans inclusive health service is trauma informed with person centred care. what's not to love? oh and in case it isn't obvious I definitely *do* think we should make accomodations for d/Deaf people, blind people and yes, even vegetarians.  #trans #AI #chatgpt #transgender #pregnancy #healthcare #troll #lgbt #1 </content>

    <content>Replying to @emrhibee if someone falls pregnant and wants to continue a pregnancy then they must stop taking it immediately. this is no different than if someone is on any meds that can impact a pregnancy.  I train midwives to refer to obstetrician care if there's an overlap of testosterone with pregnancy and this is just another reason why training is so important. #trans #testosterone #hormones #pregnancy #obstetrics #midwifery </content>
