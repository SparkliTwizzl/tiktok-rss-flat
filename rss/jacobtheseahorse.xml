    <title>Replying to @akj7368 I hope this clarifies things both trans and cis people have genders, the only difference is that our genders don'tv align with our sex at birth (and the gender assumptions that come along with that) #trans #cis #gender #transgender #q</title>

    <content>last year I found footage of my early transition. I did YouTube vlogs from the day I came out to my family until 3 years on testosterone.  I realised that the recordings I have of myself singing gave me a unique opportunity, an unexpected #duet 13 years in the making. every time I watch it I get chills without fail.  #trans #transition #duet #duetwithme (literally) #duetwithmyself #transgender #testosterone #music #musical #muse #feelinggood #nina #lgbt #queer #hope  #joy #chills </content>

    <content>thank you for your thoughtful comments, I appreciate your kindness. I absolutely agree where the fear is coming from, but I strongly feel it's not only misdirected, but that the fear itself is being created through disinformation by people who want to uphold patriarchy.  trans people are not only a useful scapegoat, but the arguments used to harm us also harm cis women (e.g. that there's a "right way" to be a women, and others). I hope we can continue to build bridges between us and fight to change the system together #trans #gender #feminism #feminist #transpregnancy #lgbt #birth #pregnancy </content>
