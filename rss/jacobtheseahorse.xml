    <title>Replying to @j.j_ghostly there's no guarantees, it really depends on your surgery and recovery as well as how hormones affect you. also don't forget if you have taken testosterone it's important to stop to get pregnant üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è #trans #transman #chestsurgery</title>

    <content>Replying to @kismetkat22 when looking at maternity, of course it's language that has previously only been for women, but saying that trans inclusion only ever impacts language for women is untrue (for example when we talk about healthcare for anyone with a prostate). but focusing only on women is part of a wider tactic that paints trans people as powerful monsters and women as victims.  please know I'm not accusing you (commentor) with this, but your questions are phrased in a way that suggests you've been exposed to this narrative. when trans people are included it destabilises the power of cis men who want to keep us down so they are seeking to divide us and make us fear each other, instead of the true people with power. #trans #feminism #lgbt #feminism #feminist #intersectionalfeminism #transgender #queertok #queer #ally #translivesmatter #transwomenarewomen </content>

    <content>a really lovely OT reached out to me to offer support on a tiktok earlier and my first response was a trauma response because of this experience. one of many instances of medical trauma that I've experienced over the years. sorry to be a Debby Downer but my guess is I'm not the only one on here who has these kinds of experiences. the intersection of ADHD, autism, menstrual health and mental health all coincidence here and with distanced hindsight of nearly 20 years I can see how vulnerable my young self was. they deserved better. #ot #medical #medicaltrauma #lgbt #period #pmdd #depression #mentalhealth #pms </content>
