    <title>if you have ideas of where I can host this kind of content please let me know I think it's really valuable to normalise trans bodies, especially within birthwork and also outside of corn material. my mailing list is the best place to get updates, find it </title>

    <title>Replying to @riojarose I was raised by my grandparents and was never given a clear explanation as to why. for that reason it's so important to me that I give clear, understandable information to my kids. #trans #transparent #gentleparent #loved #honest </title>

    <title>Replying to @sunrise_sam ah there it is. it doesn't usually take long for the true colours to show. cis is not a harmful term, it just means "not-trans", the pushback against it is entirely driven by transphobia #cis #trans #honesty #queer #lgbt #queertok</title>

    <title>Replying to @akj7368 I hope this clarifies things both trans and cis people have genders, the only difference is that our genders don'tv align with our sex at birth (and the gender assumptions that come along with that) #trans #cis #gender #transgender #q</title>
