I realised that the recordings I have of myself singing gave me a unique opportunity, an unexpected #duet 13 years in the making. every time I watch it I get chills without fail.  #trans #transition #duet #duetwithme (literally) #duetwithmyself #transgender #testosterone #music #musical #muse #feelinggood #nina #lgbt #queer #hope  #joy #chills </content>

    <content>as a trans person in the UK right now, my everyday is smothered in an existential fear that I can't even articulate. I'm going to be taking time off work to look after myself but you can support what we do by getting t-shirts or you can also buy me a coffee to support me while I recoup. it's all appreciated and it all keeps me going as we fight this. thanks folks #trans #transgender #ally #support #transphobia #transrights #transrightsarehumanrights #lgbtq #lgbtqia #politics </content>
