    <title>Replying to @princessyasmine12 I didn't breastfeed, I did lactate and make a small amount of milk for my babies because human bodies are amazing. what's also amazing is that people who haven't given birth can also lactate and make milk for their babies. m</title>

    <title>I don't know where I would have given birth if I could have trusted that I wouldn't have been misgendered in hospital.  on reflection, perhaps I didn't truly have birth choices because hospital didn't feel like a choice for me. #birth #pregnancy #midwife </title>

    <content>thank you for your thoughtful comments, I appreciate your kindness. I absolutely agree where the fear is coming from, but I strongly feel it's not only misdirected, but that the fear itself is being created through disinformation by people who want to uphold patriarchy.  trans people are not only a useful scapegoat, but the arguments used to harm us also harm cis women (e.g. that there's a "right way" to be a women, and others). I hope we can continue to build bridges between us and fight to change the system together #trans #gender #feminism #feminist #transpregnancy #lgbt #birth #pregnancy </content>
