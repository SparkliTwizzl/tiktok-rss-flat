I'm lucky to have a nurse who makes the effort to go above and beyond, but if she didn't follow my sample through then we may never see the results or it may never get tested. we need a system based on the reality of people's bodies, not an arbitrary one based on assumptions of gender. #trans #healthcare #smeartest #papsmear #cervicalscreening #mybody </content>
