    <title>I don't know where I would have given birth if I could have trusted that I wouldn't have been misgendered in hospital.  on reflection, perhaps I didn't truly have birth choices because hospital didn't feel like a choice for me. #birth #pregnancy #midwife </title>

    <content>thank you for your thoughtful comments, I appreciate your kindness. I absolutely agree where the fear is coming from, but I strongly feel it's not only misdirected, but that the fear itself is being created through disinformation by people who want to uphold patriarchy.  trans people are not only a useful scapegoat, but the arguments used to harm us also harm cis women (e.g. that there's a "right way" to be a women, and others). I hope we can continue to build bridges between us and fight to change the system together #trans #gender #feminism #feminist #transpregnancy #lgbt #birth #pregnancy </content>
