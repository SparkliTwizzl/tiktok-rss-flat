    <title>Replying to @loubowers3 great question! testosterone won't stop a pregnancy but for many people while they're taking it they wouldn't be able to get pregnant. for lots of reasons it's important to stop testosterone if you're wanting to get pregnant #testo</title>

    <content>Replying to @alisonsaxby thanks for saying I'm lovely, I try to provide a space where we can talk about these tricky things. usually when someone doesn't like the term cisgender, it's because they've heard bad things about it. but at the core, there's genuinely nothing to actually dislike.  there was the same pushback about the word "straight" back in the day. ultimately, trans people and cis people have different experiences and it's valuable to be able to talk about that. you don't have to use the word for yourself, but it still exists and is useful regardless  #trans #cis #allosexual #asexual #lgbt #queer </content>
