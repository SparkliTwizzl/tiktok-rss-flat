    <content>3 out of 4 days down at #fanexpo and I am feeling the wear and tear on my body, but the soul is happy with all the moments we had with friends new and "family" alike. My favorite experience is with the kids, as they are so into cosplay and just wanna forget reality for a sec. which, I think we all understand. I often bring props n shiz for them to use while posing with me in pics, to get into character and have that full cosplay experience.  There was a girl yesterday, who was over the moon that I allowed her to pick any pirate prop to pose with Cap'n Harley. She is neurospicey and her Dad was so sweet and appreciative. that's why I so this. I was lucky to have ppl inspire and believe in me as a kid, I want to do the same in return. ‚ù§Ô∏èüíã be the change, the good tou want to see in this world. lead by example </content>
