    <content>I met soo many people over the last 3 days! It was truly the best con yet. just a few highlights: meeting Doug Jones and talking costumes, met the mua of the strain and so many shows I love, Carry Elwes melting over my treat bags, and my besties from Texas chainsaw massacre! There is nothing like watching your kiddo play with horror movie icons all weekend! I made trick or treat bags for the celebs and their agents, out of the spirit...and the reactions I got were priceless. all around best weekend in ages ‚ù§Ô∏èüéà #frightmareinthefalls #spookyseason #comiccon </content>
